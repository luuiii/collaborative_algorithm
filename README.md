## collaborative_algorithm
### Jia & Shuoxin & Song - created @ 2020.11.16

dates:
- ~~Deadline of application for IMWI-concert:2020.11.30~~
- IMWI-concert: 2021.01.29
- (?) Live coding concert: unknown

#### Study of Collaborative Algorithm: <br>
Algorithm in context of Network Music: how could Algorithm be collaborative and distributed?

#### state: <br>
- implemented simple distributed markov chain
- code structure of OSCdefs for multiple individual chains
- simple sound

#### to-do:
- ~~responding state chart for every one~~ 
- build prototype of the "presentation board"
- build connection between chains
- waitTime globle map (important)

#### idea-box:
- a new chain with a threshold reaching retrigger machanism that a same process would grow over and over but always with various time path
- sound with varing spectrum (DynKlang?)
- granular synthesis

sound idea/logic: (notes from 12.7.) <br>
1. the performance is a whole process, this process is about the 3 collaborators building up 1 timbre;<br>
2. pointillistic music, so to speak. 3 collaborators share 1 algorithm, but make different sounds, contingency and tacet are very important, must take into consideration. <br>
and so on...
