### Jia & Shuoxin & Song - created @ 2020.11.16

dates:
- ~~Deadline of application for IMWI-concert:2020.11.30~~
- ~~IMWI-concert: 2021.01.29~~canceled
- TOPLAP Birthday Stream - 19.Feb.2021 - CET 21:00 - 01:00

#### Questions:
- Algorithm in context of Network Music: how could Algorithm be collaborative and distributed?
- If we understand algorithm as function, (how) could they be composed together?
- What ist one's identity in collaborative algorithm?

#### state: <br>
- implemented simple distributed markov chain
- code structure of OSCdefs for multiple individual chains
- simple sound
- state chart presentation prototype
- new chain \buildUp with a threshold-reaching-retrigger machanism

#### off-line to-do:
- optimize the performing window content
- optimize the \buildUp sound

#### to-do:
- add kill and start for chains
- build connection between chains

- new sound mapping for \slow and \fast 
- work on performance structures

- decide what to show on the performing window

#### idea-box:
- granular synthesis
- chain modulate chain?
- \buildUp structure >> the freq-array morphing



#### notes:
sound idea/logic: (notes from 12.7.) <br>
1. the performance is a whole process, this process is about the 3 collaborators building up 1 timbre(Klanggebilde/Teiltongebilde);<br>
2. pointillistic music, so to speak. 3 collaborators share 1 algorithm, but make different sounds, contingency and tacet are very important, must take into consideration. <br>
and so on...
