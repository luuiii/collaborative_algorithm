## collaborative_algorithm
### Jia & Shuoxin & Song - created @ 2020.11.16

dates:
- ~~Deadline of application for IMWI-concert:2020.11.30~~
- IMWI-concert: 2021.01.29
- (?) Live coding concert: unknown

#### Study of Collaborative Algorithm: <br>
- Algorithm in context of Network Music: how could Algorithm be collaborative and distributed?
- If we understand algorithm as function, (how) could they be composed together?
- What ist one's identity in collaborative algorithm?

#### state: <br>
- implemented simple distributed markov chain
- code structure of OSCdefs for multiple individual chains
- simple sound
- responding state chart for every one
- state chart presentation prototype

#### to-do:
- build connection between chains
- rethink about waitTime map frequency. this blurred the identity too much. do we want that?
- granular synthesis
- a new chain with a threshold reaching retrigger machanism that let a same processs grow over and over but always with various time path - sound with varing spectrum (DynKlang)

#### idea-box:
- chain modulate chain?
- would be cool to be able to kill a chain and start a new one. (what does it mean in communication?) This may get us out of the force of (automatically) making dissicion. 



#### notes:
sound idea/logic: (notes from 12.7.) <br>
1. the performance is a whole process, this process is about the 3 collaborators building up 1 timbre(Klanggebilde/Teiltongebilde);<br>
2. pointillistic music, so to speak. 3 collaborators share 1 algorithm, but make different sounds, contingency and tacet are very important, must take into consideration. <br>
and so on...
