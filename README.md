#### Study of Collaborative Algorithm: <br>
Algorithm in context of Network Music: how could Algorithm be collaborative?
  

#### State: <br>
implemented simple distributed markov chain <br>
[0,1,2]


#### to-do: <br>
responding state chart for every one <br>
sound

sound idea/logic: (notes from our last meeting) <br>
1. the performance is a whole process, this process is about the 3 collaborators building up 1 timbre;<br>
2. pointillistic music, so to speak. 3 collaborators share 1 algorithm, but make different sounds, contingency and tacet are very important, must take into consideration. <br>
and so on...
